# Seoul-Bikes-Sharing-Demand-Project
In 2015 a bike rentals service was founded, Seoul Bikes, to promote sustainable means of travel in South Korea. 

By making use of the Seoul Bikes Sharing Demand dataset, the main goal of this project consists in predicting the number of bikes necessary to maintain this service as efficient as possible.

It is important to know the following about the project:
- it was developed in Python for the course "Projeto Aplicado em CiÃªncia de Dados I" in the Data Science Bsc at ISCTE-IUL.
- the report on it is written in Portuguese (PT-PT);
- it follows the CRISP-DM methodology;
- the four seasons of the year, metereological conditions, and events that may lead to an increase in bike rentals (concerts, local festivals, etc...), are taken into consideration for the final prediction.
